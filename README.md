# PC-reports

We are using Planning Center sevices at our church her in Sandnes, Norway. To ease our work around administration I have created some tools and reports that we are using.

A little overview:
Overview of who has responsibility when;
- This is a report that shows the persons with assigned responsibility in an easy overview

Tono report
- In Norway we need to quarterly report our song use to Tono. Tono has an old reporting format pasting the songs into a MS Word file and sending it via email, so the report generates a table for each quarter that can be pasted into the Word document

Song information update
- When reporting to Tono a special format needs to be used, so this is an easy mass song update tool

Controll of songs in the song database
- To make our work with the projector easier, we are using the Planning Center as the master for all songs and liturgy in our services, just importing everything into OpenLP. Everything that "goes on the wall" is generated using a modified version of this plugin. (Our modified code is not ready for sharing yet, but will come :-)) But for the import to go smooth, the formatting of the songs and sequence in PC needs to be on the correct setup, and this is a report that checks the format, line length. It is also possible to generate a playlist directly in Spotify if the spotify link is added to the song in PC.


Cell group admin
- This is a tool to assign cell grouo responsibilities to our services

Semester planning of services
- We are planning a 6 month semester ahead, and to make the generation of services easier, this is a tool to create many plans automaticly


To my defence I haven't beein programming since university 20 years ago, so I picked up the art a year ago, so please beer over with some of the quality of the code. It is getting better :-) But the code is badly documented, so you need to know your PHP to keep up with whats happening.
